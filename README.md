Questions List:
1. [Given a sorted array of integers, find index of first and last occurance of a given
number.If the element is not found in an array, report that as well.](/ap1.cpp)
2. [Given a sorted array, find a given element in O (Log n) time.](/ap2.cpp)
3. [Given an Array, find peack element in it.APeack elements is the element that is
greater than its neighbours.](/ap3.cpp)
4. [Given an Array, find the number of inversions of it. If (i and A (i) >A (j)) then
the pair (i, j) is called the inversion of the array. We need to count all such pairs
of inversions of Array.](/ap4.cpp)
5. [Given an array of integers, find the minimum and maximum elements persents
in it by doing minimum comparisions by using divide and conauer approach.](/ap5.cpp)
